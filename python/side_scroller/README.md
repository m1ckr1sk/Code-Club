# Side Scroller
This is a simple example of putting together a side scrolling platfromer using PyGame.

## Getting Started
To get started you will need to install the PyGame module by running the following command in the command line.

```
pip install pygame
```

You can then run the game by entering

```
python main.py
```

from the directory containing the code.

## The Code

The code has been refactored but is originally from a
[series](http://programarcadegames.com/) from [Simpson College Computer Science](http://simpson.edu/computer-science/).
 
The original code can be found at the [program arcade games website](http://programarcadegames.com/python_examples/f.php?file=platform_jumper.py)
 
An [explanation video](http://youtu.be/BCxWJgN4Nnc) is also available.
 
The exercise is part of a series on PyGame:
