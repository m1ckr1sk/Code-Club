# Summer Term 2018 Challenge - Welcome to Abbotswood

## Whats going on?
In September, many of you will be either entering your final year or leaving Abbotswood Junior School....sad times....

However, over the past few years you have built up a good amount of knowledge about school life at Abbotswood and combined with the skills you have learnt at club club you could make a difference to those children stepping through the doors of abbotswood for the first time.  

Thinking back to how you felt when you joined:

* what were you nervous about?  
* what did you wish you knew? 
* How did you find out where to go?  
* How did you learn about your class mates names?.....

## What do I have to do?
Your task is to design an application to help welcome the new children to Abbotswood Junior School.  

You have 4 weeks to complete your initial project. This can be done at code club or at home. 

You can use any of the programming languages you have learnt or even a new one from the [code club project](https://codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/) website.

* Python
* HTML/CSS/Javascript
* Scratch
* Micro Bit

## Where do I start?
Think of a problem you encountered when ou arrived at Abbotswood:

* How do you get around?
* Where are the class rooms?
* I lost my PE kit....
* I didn't know the teachers
* I didn't know my class mates
* I wasn't very good at spelling
* I struggled at maths
* I didn't know what the after school clubs were like
* Something else.............

Once you have a problem, how could you solve it?  

* I could create an adventure game set in Abbotswood!
* I could set up a lost property finding system!
* I could create a teacher register!
* I could write a maths or spelling game!

### Some tips
* Be creative.  
* Plan your project.  
* Tackle the solution in small chunks - a small working application is always better than a large non working project.
* Save your work often.
* Think about who the final users will be.
* Use the code club projects as a base and adapt them.  All the answers are in the code club projects somewhere, you need to find them.......

## What are the Rules?
* You may work on your own or in a pair.  
* If you work in a pair, both of you **must** contribute.  
* You must be able to explain how your application works
* Your application can be functional or fun
* You must be ready to present your work to the rest of the code club in 4 weeks time (21st May 2018)

## What do we win?
The most important thing is that you will win the respect and admiration of your fellow code clubbers.  

After the final presentation there will be a secret ballot to find the best project.  The winner will win a small prize.

The judging criteria will be based on :

*  Creativity
*  Functionality
*  Usefulness
