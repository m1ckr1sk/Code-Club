# Introduction
Area for python projects from the code club.

## RPG
In this project, youâ€™ll design and code your own RPG maze game. 

The aim of the game will be to collect objects and escape from a house, making sure to avoid all the monsters!

This is based on the original RPG code from the [code club website](https://codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/python/rpg/) but has a few student suggested additions.

### Additions
* Mulitple items in a room
* Items with spaces in the name, e.g. Brussel Sprout
* Escape the monster timer (once the monster is spotted you have 5 seconds to escape the room)
