# Code Club
## Introduction
This is a small repo with some examples, links and resources used for code club.  Information on the code club movement can be found on their [website](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/).

The code club currently runs two modules
* scratch for beginners
* Python for intermediery/advanced

All beginners start at the code [club project site](https://codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/).  All the information required to get started is located here with links to small starter projects and all the teaching material.

## Scratch
Scratch is a free, graphical programming language that can be run on many devices and also online.

With Scratch, you can program your own interactive stories, games, and animations — and share your creations with others in the online community.

Scratch helps young people learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively — essential skills for life in the 21st century.

### Links
The scratch [homepage](https://scratch.mit.edu/) will give you all the information to get started. You can either download scratch and install it locally or if you have an internet connection you can create scratch projects online and save them to your computer locally.

## Python
Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. An interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets or keywords), and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in other languages.

Python interpreters are available for many operating systems, allowing Python code to run on a wide variety of systems.
