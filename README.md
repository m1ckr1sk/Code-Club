# Code Club

## Introduction

This is a small repo with some examples, links and resources used for code club.  Information on the code club movement can be found on their [website](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/).

The code club currently runs two modules

* scratch for beginners
* Python for intermediate/advanced

All beginners start at the code [club project site](https://codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/).  All the information required to get started is located here with links to small starter projects and all the teaching material.

## Scratch

Scratch is a free, graphical programming language that can be run on many devices and also online.

With Scratch, you can program your own interactive stories, games, and animations — and share your creations with others in the online community.

Scratch helps young people learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively — essential skills for life in the 21st century.

We are currently using Scratch version 3 or above.

A scratch [quiz](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/17920411/) is a good way to test your knowledge.

### How do I do jumping

Jumping is covererd [here](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Jumping)

### How do I create scrolling game

Scrolling is covered [here](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Scrolling_Platformer_Tutorial)

### Scratch Links

The scratch [homepage](https://scratch.mit.edu/) will give you all the information to get started. You can either download scratch and install it locally or if you have an internet connection you can create scratch projects online and save them to your computer locally.

The offline version of scratch is available on most mobile devices.

The windows download can be found [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/download)

## Python

Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. An interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets or keywords), and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in other languages.

Python interpreters are available for many operating systems, allowing Python code to run on a wide variety of systems. You can download it from the links below or if you have an internet connection then you can use Trinket.io to run python online.  Both are free and do not require any account sign up.

We are currently using Python version 3 or above.

### Saving your work with Trinket.IO when working at school

Its good practice to save your work regularly.  However, due to restrictions on download at school you will need follow these steps to save your work:

1. Create a word document on your computer in your documents area.  Name it Python_Projects.doc.
2. Once you are ready to save, use the 'link' option on trinket to generate a web address.
    ![Trinket 1](images/trinket1.PNG "Trinket 1")
3. Copy this web address and paste it into your new word document.
    ![Trinket 2](images/trinket2.PNG "Trinket 2")
4. Save the document.

When you want to load your work to continue:

1. Open your word document, Python_Projects.doc.
2. Copy the web address you saved from your last session and paste it into your web browser address bar.

### Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger. Most modern IDEs have intelligent code completion.

Moving from Scratch to Python is, visually, a bit of a jump.  If you are using trinket then this may not be much of an issue but if you choose to download the Python interpreter onto your local machine then you may want to consider installing a Python IDE.

There are many options but for starting out I would choose either:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - my personal favourite and the one I use professionally. It requires the python plugin to get going.   It can also be used for lots of other languages too.
* [PyCharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows) - probably the simplest to use
* [PyScripter](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyscripter/) - Another great beginner IDE

All the above IDEs are free and do not require you to create an account.  **They must be downloaded and installed after you have installed the Python interpreter.**

### Python Links

[Code combat](https://www.codecombat.com) uses a simple game to teach syntax and is a superb stepping stone from scratch to Python.  The first few levels are free without account sign up.  A free account can be created to access the majority of the levels and premium option is available for more further features and levels.  I would say this is the childrens favourite resource for learning coding.

There is an introduction to python and trinket on the [code club projects site](https://codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/resources/python-intro/)

You can download python from the python [website](https://www.python.org/)

## Other Stem Resources

Alongside programming resources there are a number of other resources available that offer an introduction to STEM activities.  Some will require a small investment but these have all been "battle" tested with kids from school or with my own children.

### Raspberry Pi

For a small investment the [rapsberry pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) can provide a wealth of learning. The raspberry PI is a small board computer that can be hooked up to a monitor, keyboard and mouse to provide pretty much everything you need to complete all the activities I've listed above.  Once you've completed that there is an almost endless set of projects that can be completed online with the raspberry pi.  Once the Raspbian operating system is installed (most come with it pre installed) the raspberry pi has both scratch and python installed by default.  The Pi can also be extended in numerous ways and with the Pins it can be used to connect to electronic circuits.  I would say that kids from around 10+ find the Pi fairly simple to get around and operate.

### BBC Micro Bit

Much like the raspberry Pi, the [BBC microbit](https://microbit.org/) is a small board computer but is slightly more accessible.  You can programme the boards LEDs, sensors and buttons using scratch to create all sorts of interesting projects.  It has some Pins to enable it to be connected to electronic circuits and other accessories. Its not as versatile as the raspberry pi but the kids in the class enjoyed completing the projects and freestyling their own projects.  A random insult generator that one of the children created was a big hit.

### Snap Circuits

[Snap circuits](https://www.elenco.com/brand/snap-circuits/) are great kits that introduce the children to electronic circuits.  The kits range in price and have lots of different accessories from simple buzzers, lights and sensors to integrating into raspberry pi's.  The kits are well made and come with lots of different projects.  My youngest (8) has completed most of the 100 piece kit projects and gets great pleasure in showing us how it works.

### Turing Tumble

The [turing tumble](https://www.turingtumble.com/) is fantastic for and introduction into logic problems.  It is a simple concept to introduce kids to logic gates but is extremely well done and the kids are really well made.  They are quite pricey, (I managed to pick one up for around £50) but its probably my favourite piece of kit because you don't need batteries, you don't need to plug it in, you don't need to support them using it other than a quick intro and the progresssion in difficulty is very gradual.  The marbles are quite fiddly so I'd recommend getting a magnet with it.  A colleague introduced this to me and told me it was for children but I have a suspicion that we both play it more than the kids.
